# âœ§ Polaris
A Programming Test for Sorenson Media by Rob Johansen
Project Description
-----
Polaris is a RESTful web service for managing a video library. It provides endpoints for creating, listing, updating, and deleting videos comprised of the following four attributes:

* title
* description
* producers
* actors

Polaris runs on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) web framework, and the [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) template engine. It persists a video library to a [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) database, utilizing stored procedures via a centralized, data-layer service. The server-side development of Polaris was behavior-driven, using the [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) test framework and the [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) assertion library. The Polaris user interface employs the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework, as well as the [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) and [jQuery]() libraries.

Usage Instructions
-----
This section describes how to obtain, set up, and run Polaris.

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/).
2. Install [MySQL](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) (v5.6.22 was used during development).
3. Clone this project:
   `git clone https://github.com/stenrap/sorenson-test.git`
4. From the root of the project directory, and with the appropriate MySQL permissions, execute the sql/setup.sql script. For example:
   `mysql -u root -p < sql/setup.sql`
5. Install Mocha:
   `npm install -g mocha`
6. To execute the project's tests at any time, simply execute this command from the project root:
   `mocha`
7. To launch Polaris, execute this command from the project root:
   `node bin/www`

Known Issues
-----
* The number links for pagination are not always correctly enabled/disabled when the video list is filtered by actor name.
* Refreshing the video list page after navigating to a page other than the first reloads the first page.
* If the server throws an exception, naturally it stops running (perhaps it should be invoked via [forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever)).
* Only the landing page and 'Add Video' page are truly responsive to mobile devices. The video list employs a Bootstrap responsive table, but it is a bleak experience on a phone.
* Older versions of Safari on iOS do not appear to honor the `required` HTML attribute. Thus, it is possible to submit incomplete forms in such browsers.
